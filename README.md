# Action Recognition
Welcome to the **Action Recognition** repository!. This project leverages cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning technologies to detect action in a video.

## üìÑ Introduction
This project aims to develop a comprehensive system for motion detection and object detection in ICU videos. The primary objectives are:
- This Flask application uses a pretrained TensorFlow model to classify activities in video files, predicting classes like "WalkingWithDog" and "TaiChi." 
- Processes video frames with OpenCV, resizing and normalizing them before making predictions.

## üéØ Features

**API Functionalities**
- **Predict**: Accessible using POSTMAN software with a JSON request, returning output video of action detection.

**Server Access**
- API accessible via the local host server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

 ## üì¨ Access API Using Postman Software Using JSON
To access the API using Postman, follow these steps:

Install Postman:

If you haven't already, download and install Postman from [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
Create a New Request:

Open Postman and click on New to create a new HTTP request.
Set the Request Type and URL:

Select POST as the request type.
Enter the API endpoint URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict.
Set Headers:

Click on the Headers tab and add the following key-value pair:
Content-Type: application/json
Set the Body:

Click on the Body tab and select raw and JSON (application/json).
Enter the JSON payload with the video data you want to process. For example:

Copy code
{
  "video_path": "path/to/your/video.mp4"
}

Send the Request:
Click on Send to submit your request to the API.
You should receive a response with the processed frames and video output.

For more details on using Postman, refer to the [Postman Documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/introduction/overview/).
